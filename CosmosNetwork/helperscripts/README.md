# About the Repository
This repository hosts general scripts that can be used in any project built on the Cosmos SDK. These scripts are designed to facilitate interaction with the node and validator in Cosmos SDK projects. They simplify many daily tasks associated with maintaining and managing nodes and validators.

Inside the repository, you'll find scripts, code, documentation, and other resources that we've developed as part of our work on Cosmos SDK projects. We warmly welcome any feedback or questions about our contributions, but kindly ask that you respect the fact that this repository is not intended for public contributions.

Please explore the repository and do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions regarding our work.

## Note
Please note that each project built on Cosmos SDK may have its unique features and requirements, and while these scripts are meant for general use, specific configurations or additional steps may be required for each individual project.
