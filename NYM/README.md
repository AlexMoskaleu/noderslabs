# Nym Project Repository

## About the Project

Nym is an open, decentralized system designed to safeguard user privacy on the internet. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, Nym protects metadata, the 'data about the data,' that is often left exposed even with encrypted communication. This metadata can reveal a lot about a person's activity and connections, which is why it's crucial to protect it.

Nym's mixnet routes packets in such a way that it is virtually impossible for an adversary to tell who is communicating with whom, thus effectively protecting user privacy. It is designed to be resistant to powerful system-wide adversaries and to function effectively even in adverse conditions.
