# SUI Project Repository

## About the Project

Sui is a high-performance, first-level (L1) blockchain developed by Mysten Labs to serve latency-sensitive decentralized applications.


The operation and security of the Sui network is provided by the Proof-of-Stake algorithm with the possibility of staking and delegation.
Sui's consensus process uses the unique Narwhal and Bullshark protocols to allow parallel computations, making Sui highly scalable.
